Based on my analysis i get the following results

##### RESULT

From my analysis Movies like Star Wars,Titanic,The Exorcist are the highest movies based on their revenue that they made.and also the voting count is changing over the years .Hence in they year of 2013 has the highest average voting which is 325.471927

The revenue of movie shows a strong positive correlation with vote count and popularity, which is when the vote and the popularity is increasing and that makes the revenue to get increased as well

##### Limitations

This dataset is very rich in information. Some limitations the dataset contains are null and zero values in some features. there are so many data that have been cleaned in this report. These datas are seen as inconsistency since they contains NaN and duplicates. Furthermore zero values creates false results during the correlation plots and computing the pearson correlation. Hence data cleaning is a necessary part before moving on to the dataset's investigation.
